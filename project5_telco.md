# Predicting Customer Churning with Logistic Regression

**Project Description:** In this project, I explored a dataset about customer churning and built a logistic regression model to predict whether or not a customer will unsubscribe from a company's service.

### Background

The Telco Churn dataset contains information about the customers of Telco, a telecommunications company that offers internet and phone service, and whether or not they “churned”. Churning is defined as leaving the company (i.e. unsubscribing from their services) within the last month. The dataset also contains information about a customer’s demographic and account information. The goal of this project is to build a logistic regression model that will predict whether or not a customer will cancel their services based on their features.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The first thing I did was examine the dataset and viewed the data. After performing any necessary data cleaning, my finalized dataset contains 1995 observations with 20 variables, 1 being the reponse variables, **churn**. Then, I explored the relationships of these predictors with churning. For a full view of the EDA process, check out my R Notebook here.

### Why Logistic Regression?

Logistic Regression is a classification that predicts the log-odds ratio of a customer churning. It assumes a linear relationship between the predictors and the log-odds ratio. The log-odds ratio can be converted to determine the probability of churning. THus, with the predicted probability, we can classify customers as churning or not.
