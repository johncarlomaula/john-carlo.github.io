**Project Description:** In this project, I explore the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System dataset to see if there are more injuries associated with Friday the 13th compared to other days.

The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) dataset is a collection on product-related injuries collected by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). I will be exploring data from the last 5 years to determine if more injuries occur on Friday the 13th compared to other days.

For more information on how to retrieve the data, you can visit the CSPC website here. You can also find out about how the data is collected here.

For this purpose, the Treatment Date will be used as a proxy for the date of occurrence. In reality, getting an injury treated might not be the same day as when it occurred.

### Do more injuries occur on Friday the 13th?

Based on this plot, there does not appear to be a difference between the number of injuries on Friday the 13th and other days. The number of injuries appear to depend on the time of the year, with most of the injuries occurring on May, July, and September (summer), and the least occurring on December, January, and February (winter). The only exception of this is March and April of 2020, when lockdown began for the Covid-19 pandemic.

### Are people of a certain age or sex more likely to get injured on Friday the 13th?

Based on these plots, women and men have the same likelihood of getting injured on Friday the 13th. However, men are more likely to get injured than women in general.

The same is true for age. The distribution of age isn strongly right skewed, with half the injuries ooccuring between 0 - 25 years old.
