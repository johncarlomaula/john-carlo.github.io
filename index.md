I visualized my Apple Music listening history during the time period of August 2020 - April 2022. After retrieving my personal, raw Apple data, I used SQL to organize and clean the data before importing the resulting dataset into Tableau and visualizing the data. Some metrics I explored include my top artists, top genre, and monthly hours spent listening to music. This project is WIP.

Using Streamlit, I developed a web app with a user-friendly interface to visualize Spotify music data. I also gave the option for users to download their own data to visualize. Data can be displayed via interactive histograms, box plots, scatterplots, and polar charts produced from Plotly with the ability to compare artists and albums. Example plots are shown below.

In this project, I visualized the Spotify features of Taylor Swift's and compared her albums to each other. I also built a web app with Streamlit to compare the features of her re-recordings with the original. Features of the app include the ability to select an album or individual song, and the ability to filter which features to display.

In this project, I analyze Tayor Swift's lyrics in R. I visualized the word frequency and lexical diversity of her music and analyzed the sentiments conveyed by her lyrics using 3 different lexicons: Bing, AFINN, and NRC.
