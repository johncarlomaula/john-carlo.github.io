Using Streamlit, I developed a web app with a user-friendly interface to visualize Spotify music data. I also gave the option for users to download their own data to visualize. Data can be displayed via interactive histograms, box plots, scatterplots, and polar charts produced from Plotly with the ability to compare artists and albums. Example plots are shown below.

In this project, I visualized the Spotify features of Taylor Swift's and compared her albums to each other. I also built a web app with Streamlit to compare the features of her re-recordings with the original. Features of the app include the ability to select an album or individual song, and the ability to filter which features to display.

In this project, I analyze Tayor Swift's lyrics in R. I visualized the word frequency and lexical diversity of her music and analyzed the sentiments conveyed by her lyrics using 3 different lexicons: Bing, AFINN, and NRC.
